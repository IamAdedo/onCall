# TropiCare-Telemedicine-for-Tropical-Low-Resource-Settings
TropiCare is a telemedicine web &amp; mobile backend + admin console designed specifically for clinical delivery in tropical, under-resourced, and developing regions. The system focuses on offline-first workflows, low-bandwidth media (adaptive compression, selective sync), SMS/USSD integration, and culturally localizable interfaces.

Why TropiCare?

Healthcare delivery in low-resource settings has unique constraints:

Intermittent internet access and limited bandwidth

Low device capabilities (feature phones and older smartphones)

Need for SMS / USSD integration and support for pay-as-you-go data

Cultural & language localization

Lower infrastructure budgets (cost-focused)


TropiCare is built around these constraints: modular, offline-first, and prioritizes features with the highest clinical impact.


---
Key product goals:

Connect patients in low-connectivity areas with clinicians via asynchronous messaging, low-res video, and audio calls.

Provide triage workflows for common tropical diseases (malaria, dengue, typhoid, TB, etc.) with configurable guidance for clinicians.

Support local identity options (phone-based accounts, national IDs where available).

Keep the stack simple to deploy locally (Docker Compose) while supporting a path to Kubernetes for scale.
