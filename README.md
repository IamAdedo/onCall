# TropiCare-Telemedicine-for-Tropical-Low-Resource-Settings
TropiCare is a telemedicine web &amp; mobile backend + admin console designed specifically for clinical delivery in tropical, under-resourced, and developing regions. The system focuses on offline-first workflows, low-bandwidth media (adaptive compression, selective sync), SMS/USSD integration, and culturally localizable interfaces.



Why TropiCare?

Healthcare delivery in low-resource settings has unique constraints:

Intermittent internet access and limited bandwidth

Low device capabilities (feature phones and older smartphones)

Need for SMS / USSD integration and support for pay-as-you-go data

Cultural & language localization

Lower infrastructure budgets (cost-focused)


TropiCare is built around these constraints: modular, offline-first, and prioritizes features with the highest clinical impact.





Key product goals:

Connect patients in low-connectivity areas with clinicians via asynchronous messaging, low-res video, and audio calls.

Provide triage workflows for common tropical diseases (malaria, dengue, typhoid, TB, etc.) with configurable guidance for clinicians.

Support local identity options (phone-based accounts, national IDs where available).

Keep the stack simple to deploy locally (Docker Compose) while supporting a path to Kubernetes for scale.

Architecture & Technology Stack

Design principles: small, modular microservices where necessary, but default to monorepo with separated services for faster local deployments.

Suggested stack:

Backend: Node.js + NestJS (or Express + TypeScript) for modularity and typed DTOs.

Database: PostgreSQL for relational patient/clinic data.

Cache / queues: Redis for caching and background jobs (notifications, media processing).

Object storage: MinIO (S3-compatible) for local deployments; AWS S3 for cloud.

Realtime / messaging: WebSockets via Socket.IO or Redis Pub/Sub for updates; Matrix optional.

Mobile client: React Native (Expo) for cross-platform clients; progressive web app (PWA) alternative.

Admin frontend: React + Tailwind CSS (lightweight, responsive).

Auth: JWT + refresh tokens; OTP via SMS for registration.

Media processing: FFmpeg worker for video/audio resizing and transcoding.

CI/CD: GitHub Actions example included.

Containerization: Docker + Docker Compose for local; Kubernetes manifests for production.

Database schema (core tables)

A simplified relational schema (Postgres).

-- users: clinicians & admins
CREATE TABLE users (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email text UNIQUE,
  phone text,
  role text NOT NULL,
  password_hash text,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- patients
CREATE TABLE patients (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name text,
  phone text,
  national_id text,
  dob date,
  gender text,
  address text,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- consults
CREATE TABLE consults (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  patient_id uuid REFERENCES patients(id),
  clinician_id uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  status text DEFAULT 'open',
  triage_score int,
  symptoms jsonb,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  closed_at timestamptz
);

-- messages (async chat in consult)
CREATE TABLE consult_messages (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  consult_id uuid REFERENCES consults(id),
  sender_role text,
  body text,
  attachments jsonb,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- media metadata
CREATE TABLE media (
  key text PRIMARY KEY,
  owner_id uuid,
  content_type text,
  size bigint,
  checksum text,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

Security, privacy & compliance notes

Encryption at rest: ensure object storage and DB disks are encrypted (e.g., AWS KMS or LUKS/Bitlocker for on-prem).

Encryption in transit: HTTPS everywhere with strong TLS config.

Data minimization: store only required patient data and provide retention policies.

Audit trails: record who accessed or exported patient records.

RBAC: least privilege for clinicians and admins.

Legal: this app is not a substitute for professional medical systems; check local laws (e.g., Nigeria NDPR, Ghana Data Protection Act) before production.


Privacy-first defaults are recommended for deployments in countries without specific healthcare laws.


---

Offline / low-connectivity strategy

Mobile client is offline-first: store consult drafts locally and sync only diffs when online.

Use background sync with exponential backoff and small chunked uploads for media.

Allow USSD/SMS entry for basic triage and appointment booking. Example flow: *123*45# -> 1) Enter symptoms, 2) Confirm clinic.

Lightweight media: images resized to max width 1024 and compressed; video converted to short 10–30s clips.

Local sync agent for clinics: a small node service that runs on a clinic Raspberry Pi or NUC and syncs with central server during windows of connectivity.



---

Testing & CI/CD

Tests

Unit tests: Jest (backend), React Testing Library (frontend)

Integration tests: Postman / Newman or Playwright for end-to-end flows


CI

GitHub Actions example workflows:

lint-and-test.yml — install, lint, run tests, upload coverage

docker-publish.yml — build and push images to container registry on release



Include automated security scanning (Dependabot / Snyk) and secret scanning.


---

Deployment (Docker + Kubernetes)

Docker Compose (developer) — docker-compose.yml should include:

db (Postgres)

redis

minio

backend

admin-frontend

nginx (reverse proxy / TLS termination)


Kubernetes (production)

Deploy backend as Deployment with Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

Use Postgres managed offering or StatefulSet with backups

Use MinIO or cloud S3 for media

Use Cert-Manager + Let's Encrypt for TLS

Use external-dns for DNS automation


Example Dockerfile (backend)

FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN npm i -g pnpm
RUN pnpm install
COPY . .
RUN pnpm build

FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
ENV NODE_ENV=production
CMD ["node", "dist/main.js"]


---

Monitoring & Logging

Structured logs (JSON) shipped to Elastic/EFK stack or Loki.

Application metrics with Prometheus + Grafana (requests, latencies, queue sizes, sync errors).

Alerting for critical conditions (failed backups, high media-processing queue length).



---

Internationalization & Accessibility

Use i18n (e.g., i18next) for translations; ship English and local languages (Yoruba, Hausa, Igbo, Twi, French, Portuguese, etc.) as needed.

RTL support for languages where needed.

Accessibility: keyboard navigation, large touch targets, readable font sizes, color contrast.



---

Example environment / integration notes (SMS & USSD)

SMS gateway: Twilio, Africa's Talking, or Nexmo — abstract via pluggable adapter in src/modules/notifications/providers.

USSD: Use an aggregator (Africa's Talking, Twilio's Conversations if supported) and build a flow translator to triage forms.

Payments (optional): MPesa, Flutterwave, Paystack — used for paid consults or for clinic subscriptions.


---

Diagnostics & Health checks

Expose health endpoints:

GET /health — app status

GET /health/db — DB connection

GET /health/queue — Redis/queue connection


Use liveness and readiness probes in Kubernetes.

  version: 0.1.0
paths:
  /api/v1/auth/otp/request:
    post:
      summary: Request OTP
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:

Troubleshooting

If migrations fail, confirm DATABASE_URL and run pnpm run migrate:status.

If media fails to upload, check MinIO credentials and bucket policy.

If SMS OTP fails, ensure provider credentials are correct and check the provider's logs for rejected messages.

Thank you for building responsible telemedicine tools. If you'd like, I can also:

generate starter code for the backend auth and patients modules,

provide a ready-to-run docker-compose.yml and k8s manifests,

scaffold the React admin UI pages (login, dashboard, consult page), or

create a minimal Postgres seed + migration scripts.


Pick one and I will scaffold it right away in the repo.



Done — I created a repo README in the canvas titled TropiCare — Telemedicine for Tropical & Low-Resource Settings (file: tropi-care/tropi-care-telemedicine-README.md).

It includes:

Project overview & goals

Feature list (patient & clinician flows, admin, security)

Recommended architecture & tech stack

Full scaffolded folder structure

Quickstart (Docker Compose) developer install steps and .env.example snippet

API summary + OpenAPI snippet

Core DB schema SQL examples and seed data

Offline/low-connectivity design (USSD/SMS, local sync agent, media handling)

Security, privacy & compliance guidance relevant to developing nations

Testing, CI/CD, deployment (Docker + Kubernetes) guidance and sample Dockerfile

Monitoring, i18n/accessibility, roadmap, contributing, license, and maintainer notes


If you want, I can now:

scaffold the backend auth + patients modules (TypeScript + NestJS) with routes, models, and tests, or

generate a ready-to-run docker-compose.yml and .env.example file in the repo, or

scaffold the React admin UI (login, dashboard, consult list) with Tailwind.


Tell me which of those you'd like me to generate next and I’ll add them directly into the repo canvas.
