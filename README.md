# TropiCare-Telemedicine-for-Tropical-Low-Resource-Settings
TropiCare is a telemedicine web &amp; mobile backend + admin console designed specifically for clinical delivery in tropical, under-resourced, and developing regions. The system focuses on offline-first workflows, low-bandwidth media (adaptive compression, selective sync), SMS/USSD integration, and culturally localizable interfaces.
